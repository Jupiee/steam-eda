    "# Analysis of Steam's Best Selling Games of All Time (June 1, 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a composite, created by merging data from three distinct sources to provide a richer profile for each game. The columns are sourced as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* From Steam: The core data for each game, including its name, review scores, and technical details, was scraped directly from the official Steam store page.\n",
    "-- `game_name`, `reviews_like_rate`, `all_reviews_number`, `release_date`, `developer`, `user_defined_tags`, `supported_os`, `supported_languages`, `price`, `other_features`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* From GameFAQs: To enrich the dataset with qualitative metrics, data regarding content and player experience was sourced from GameFAQs.\n",
    "-- `age_restriction`, `rating`, `difficulty`, `length`\n",
    "-- **Note:** In cases where data for a specific game was unavailable on GameFAQs, these fields were estimated by manually analyzing user reviews and discussions on the game's official Steam page.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From SteamDB: To provide an estimate of reach and ownership, download figures were sourced from the third-party statistics site SteamDB.\n",
    "-- `estimated_downloads`\n",
    "-- **Important Exclusion Criterion:** Only games for which an estimated_downloads value could be obtained from SteamDB were included in the final dataset. Games lacking this data were excluded from the list, even if they appeared in the 'Bestsellers' section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Descriptions\n",
    "* `game_name`: The official title of the game.\n",
    "* `reviews_like_rate`: The recommendation rate from user reviews on Steam (e.g., '95% of the 100 reviews are positive').\n",
    "* `all_reviews_number`: The total number of user reviews the game has received on Steam.\n",
    "* `release_date`: The official release date of the game on the Steam platform. This includes the initial release date for games in Early Access.\n",
    "* `developer`: The primary developer or studio behind the game.\n",
    "* `user_defined_tags`: A set of genres and categories assigned to the game by the Steam community (e.g., 'RPG', 'Open World', 'Story Rich').\n",
    "* `supported_os`: A list of the operating systems the game officially supports (win, mac, linux).\n",
    "* `supported_languages`: A list of languages that the game supports for interface, audio, or subtitles.\n",
    "* `price`: The price of the game. Note: The currency is MENA - U.S. Dollar, a regional price for the Middle East & North Africa, not the standard USD. A value of 0 in this column indicates the game is 'Free to Play'.\n",
    "* `other_features`: A set of features defined by Steam under the 'player support' category (e.g., 'Single-player', 'Online PvP', 'Steam Achievements', 'Family Sharing', 'Online Co-op', 'VR Supported').\n",
    "* `age_restriction`: The recommended age restriction for the game's content, encoded as follows: 0 (Everyone), 10 (10+), 13 (13+), 17 (17+).\n",
    "* `rating`: An overall user-provided rating for the game on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.\n",
    "* `difficulty`: An estimated difficulty of the game as perceived by players, on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the easiest and 5 is the hardest.\n",
    "* `length`: The average time (in hours) players spend to complete or fully experience the game. For this dataset, the value is capped at a maximum of 80 hours.\n",
    "* `estimated_downloads`: The estimated total number of owners for the game."

    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Category 1: Foundational & Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "*These are great for initial exploration and visualization.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The All-Time Greatest Hits:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** What are the top 10 games by `estimated_downloads`? Create a bar chart to visualize this.\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** How do these top games compare in terms of `price`, `reviews_like_rate`, and `all_reviews_number`? Is there a correlation between downloads and positive reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Price of Success:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** What is the distribution of `price`? (e.g., histogram). What is the most common price point for a top-selling game?\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Compare the average `price` of games with a \"Very Positive\" rating (e.g., >95% like rate) vs. \"Mixed\" ratings (e.g., 70-80% like rate). Are players more critical of expensive games?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Evolution of Gaming:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** How has the `release_date` of top-selling games changed over time? (e.g., a timeline or count of games per year). Is there a trend towards more recent games dominating the list?\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Analyze the average `price` and `estimated_downloads` over time. Have games gotten more or less expensive? Are newer games selling more copies faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Category 2: Relationship & Correlation Analysis\n",
    "*These problems look for connections between different features.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Does Price Affect Popularity?**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Is there a correlation between `price` and `estimated_downloads`? Create a scatter plot (Price vs. Downloads).\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Segment the data. Is this relationship different for indie `developers` vs. major AAA studios?\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **The Review Paradox:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Is there a relationship between the *number* of reviews (`all_reviews_number`) and the *quality* of reviews (`reviews_like_rate`)? Do more popular games have more polarized opinions?\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Calculate a \"Review Engagement\" score (e.g., `all_reviews_number` / `estimated_downloads`). Do cheaper games or certain genres have a higher review rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **The Recipe for a High-Rated Game:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** What features are most common in games with a \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" rating? Analyze `user_defined_tags`, `price` range, `developer`, and `length`.\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Are there specific tags (e.g., \"Story Rich\", \"Co-op\", \"Sandbox\") that are strongly associated with a high `reviews_like_rate`?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Category 3: Segmentation & Grouping Analysis\n",
    "*These problems involve grouping games to find patterns.*\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Developer Power Rankings:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Which `developer` has the most games on the list? Among developers with at least 2 games, which one has the highest average `reviews_like_rate` or `estimated_downloads`?\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Do certain developers consistently produce games of a specific `length`, `difficulty`, or with certain tags?\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Genre/Tag Cluster Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Using the `user_defined_tags`, can you group the games into common genres/clusters (e.g., \"Action FPS\", \"Story-Rich RPG\", \"Casual Simulation\")?\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Analyze these clusters. Which genre cluster has the highest average rating? The highest average price? The most downloads?\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **OS Market Share:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** What percentage of top-selling games are Windows-only vs. supporting Mac/Linux as well (`supported_os`)? Has this changed over time?\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Do games that support more operating systems have significantly higher `estimated_downloads`?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Category 4: Predictive & Advanced Analytical Problems\n",
    "*These are more challenging and might require machine learning or statistical modeling.*\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Predicting Success:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Can you build a model to predict a game's `estimated_downloads` (or classify it as High/Low success) based on its features: `price`, `developer` (as a categorical variable), `user_defined_tags`, `length`, etc.\n",
    "    *   **Key Challenge:** Feature engineering from `user_defined_tags` and `developer` will be crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **The \"Value for Money\" Index:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Create a composite metric that measures a game's value. For example: `Value_Index = (Length * reviews_like_rate) / Price`. Rank the games by this index.\n",
    "    *   **Follow-up:** Do high-value games consistently come from certain developers or genres? Is there a trade-off between this \"Value Index\" and sheer download numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Niche vs. Mainstream:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Define \"Niche\" (e.g., games with specific tags like \"Atmospheric\", \"Difficult\", \"Permadeath\") and \"Mainstream\" (e.g., \"Action\", \"Adventure\", \"Casual\"). Compare their average `reviews_like_rate`, `all_reviews_number`, and `price`. Do niche games have a more dedicated, positive fanbase?\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Language and Global Appeal:**\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Analyze the `supported_languages` column. Does the number of supported languages correlate with `estimated_downloads`? Are there specific languages (like Simplified Chinese, Russian) whose inclusion is a strong predictor of higher downloads?"
